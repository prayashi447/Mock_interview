SQL,How would you design a data pipeline that can process large volumes of real-time data from multiple sources and store the results in a structured format using SQL?,"One possible approach is to use the Apache Kafka streaming platform to collect and aggregate the data from various sources, such as sensors, web applications, or cloud services. Then, use the Apache Arrow library to perform the data processing tasks, such as filtering, grouping, aggregating, or mapping, on the data. Finally, use the Apache Spark SQL toolkit to write the results to a SQL database, such as PostgreSQL, and handle the data integrity, security, and scalability issues. Here is a sample Python code snippet that demonstrates this workflow:
